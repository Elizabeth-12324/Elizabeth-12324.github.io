      Despite being written nearly 65 years apart from one another, both articles we read for homework this past week had strikingly similar core ideas that truely surprise when considering the vastly different worlds both authors lived in. “As We May Think”, written by Vannevar Bush in 1945 towards the close of the second World War, calls upon the direction of science to shift towards becoming more accessible for public consumption. Through the use of what he calls a “Memex”, individuals could store books or records in order to create a sort of collective memory. In essence, allowing the public more unrestricted, easy access to knowledge that could potentially help solve many world issues through having an educated populus.

        Meanwhile, “Long Live the Web” by Tim Berners Lee, revolves around the importance of the internet remaining an unbiased source of information as we enter an era in which big named companies and corporations chip away at online freedom of knowledge for their own benefit. As the founding father of the world wide web, Lee is in essence greatly disrtubred by the disappearance of free speech on the internet.

        I found it incredibly interesting how both of these articles essentially focus around the core principal of internet freedom, an issue that still remains a big problem today as its becoming incredibly difficult to navigate through a world in which many corporations are directly in charge of what kind of media you may consume. Whether it be through Facebook's inability to accurately fact check many claims made on its platform during the election process, or Youtube's recommendation algorithm constantly refreshing our feeds with the latest viral videos, for many of us, the content we see on a daily basis lies directly in the hands of these corporations. Yet when we decide to break away from the pre approved sources of information, a borderline censorship can occur as the very idea the internet was founded upon, breaks down and leaves us with a skewed, biased interpretation of knowledge as we are only fed the information approved by outside sources, in essence centralizing the web. This centralization can possibly become the worst thing to ever happen to the internet, as its power, its allure, comes from the idea that anyone can have a voice online and that a world of information is at the tip of your fingers. Even from an era before the internet, Bush was able to recognize the importance of having a system in place in which the free exchange of information can occur, through accessible means to the public. Unfortunately however, despite achieving this very thing Bush only dreamed of, it becomes a growing concern that one day, the “world wide web” won't be as world wide as we believed it to be, launching us back into the debate over the importance of free knowledge online.
