       <h1> Ways of seeing- John Berger </h1>

    <h2>
      The art of modern day photography has allowed us to bring art into our own homes, our jobs, our screens. What once required a trip to a museum is available for anyone to reproduce into practially any surface. However, this idea of copying a copy of a copy leads to debate over if the original value/sentiment of the painting is worth more than its reproductions. Does being the original come with an inherit value if what the individual takes away remains the same?
 <br>
 <br>
 The hypocrisy of the male gaze depicited through the how women were styled nude in paintings but were unable to embrace this sexuality and body as their own. Meanwhile, religious and societal expectations for women were to remain pure.
 <br>
 <br>
 Social media has since become a platform of envy as influencers and marketers alike try to sell the image of an ideal life style, one that you can be a part of too if you buy their product or join their buisness
